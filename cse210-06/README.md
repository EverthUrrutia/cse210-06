final project: CSE 210
Name: Everth Urrutia

The game that I made for my final project is the classic game of ping pong, where two opponents try to take the ball to the opposite field, the player who reaches five points wins, in this game the programming principles were applied, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and maintainability, the game is played with the W and S keys for player A, and the U and J keys for player B, finally the dialogues were put in Spanish since it is my native language, in addition to allowing my brothers play the game since they do not understand English.
